This file is meant to configure the user configurable
parameters of the software. If you're just starting out
with this, make sure to at least adjust the addresses of
your temperature sensors, as you will otherwise get an
error! The address that's written here is just an example.

// "detaching" before and after every move. The defined time here ist

// SAFETY FEATURE

// As a safety feature a watchdog timer can be used to reset the Arduino in case
// of a software-lock. In the worst case the software would get stuck while the
// heater is running, which could result in high temperatures inside the
// enclosure and ultimately, if lots of things go wrong, in a fire. To prevent
// this you can use a watchdog, which will restart the Arduino if the watchdog
// is not reset after a specified time, in this case 4 seconds. As there is a
// bug in the Arduino Nanos old Bootloader, you should only use this with a Nano
// which already has the new Bootloader. In my experience, all of the cheap
// clone models use the old one. Only the original Arduino Unos are shipping
// with the new one. You can update your Bootloader yourself, i.e. with another
// Arduino. See:
// https://docs.arduino.cc/built-in-examples/arduino-isp/ArduinoISP/
// *** DO NOT USE WATCHDOG IF YOUR BOARD IS nanoatmega328, this is the old
// Bootloader! ***
// *** ONLY USE WITH nanoatmega328new ***
// *** YOU COULD SOFTBRICK YOUR BOARD ***

// #define USE_WATCHDOG
